       "\"Thanks, Ian. Wanted to talk a little bit about what we're doing in Ventures and put that into the broader context of how we think about new business development in the P&C division. Because I was talking about Ventures, I had intended to come today dressed in the typical Silicon Valley Ventures sort of outfit. And so I wear that to the office one day and Denis said, why are you wearing pajamas? So that was the end of that. Anyway, what we're working on, on the P&C side, I want to put it in the broader context. You've heard a little bit about some of the internal development that we've done. When there is a system or a process that is going to drive our competitive advantage, we develop that internally. And so all of our core systems have been developed internally off of the Omega backbone. At the far side of the slide then, there are a number of market-wide initiatives, which have also been discussed today. Where there is a big challenge and where it makes sense to do it in partnership with others across the industry such as the examples that you see there, SCOR is very supportive of that sort of effort too. So I want to talk about this middle column that you see on the slide, which is where we think about partnerships. We have engaged over the years in a number of co-development initiatives. And we look to continue to do that with leading-edge companies in our space. We also provide reinsurance for clients across a number of different areas when they are doing something innovative. And lastly, in the P&C Ventures activity, which we started in 2017, we've done a number of things there quietly under the radar actually. But we've done 5 investment and/or capacity deals with young underwriting-oriented companies so far. Hopefully, that'll be 6 by the end of the week. And we have a very robust pipeline of additional companies in late stage. So what are we trying to do there? Like I said, we're focused on underwriting-oriented companies. And we make investments in those companies. And we also provide them with insurance licenses or -- and/or reinsurance capacity. We focus on underwritingoriented companies because that's what we know. We invest in what we know. We have an investment committee, which oversees this activity with Victor, Laurent and a few other senior executives of the division. And we have a number of people who are coming from both finance and underwriting backgrounds, who are responsible for helping to develop these ideas and initiatives before we actually invest. So it's always a central partnership plus a local partnership in order to make this happen. We focus on relatively material investments. So we want to be a material part of the companies, which we're backing. We focus on long-term investments, which align incentives with the founders. And we focus on companies that are doing something that's particularly interesting in some sort of niche environment or niche capacity to avoid the competition issues that were mentioned earlier. So we're very excited about what we've done. Not all of our investments are public. But we've done a lot. And we believe we've got a very robust pipeline to continue to learn and potentially get attractive results from both the reinsurance and the investments that we're making. So any questions? Okay.\""

       "\"Adrian Jones Thanks, Ian. Wanted to talk a little bit about what we're doing in Ventures and put that into the broader context of how we think about new business development in the P&C division. Because I was talking about Ventures, I had intended to come today dressed in the typical Silicon Valley Ventures sort of outfit. And so I wear that to the office one day and Denis said, why are you wearing pajamas? So that was the end of that. Anyway, what we're working on, on the P&C side, I want to put it in the broader context. You've heard a little bit about some of the internal development that we've done. When there is a system or a process that is going to drive our competitive advantage, we develop that internally. And so all of our core systems have been developed internally off of the Omega backbone. At the far side of the slide then, there are a number of market-wide initiatives, which have also been discussed today. Where there is a big challenge and where it makes sense to do it in partnership with others across the industry such as the examples that you see there, SCOR is very supportive of that sort of effort too. So I want to talk about this middle column that you see on the slide, which is where we think about partnerships. We have engaged over the years in a number of co-development initiatives. And we look to continue to do that with leading-edge companies in our space. We also provide reinsurance for clients across a number of different areas when they are doing something innovative. And lastly, in the P&C Ventures activity, which we started in 2017, we've done a number of things there quietly under the radar actually. But we've done 5 investment and/or capacity deals with young underwriting-oriented companies so far. Hopefully, that'll be 6 by the end of the week. And we have a very robust pipeline of additional companies in late stage. So what are we trying to do there? Like I said, we're focused on underwriting-oriented companies. And we make investments in those companies. And we also provide them with insurance licenses or -- and/or reinsurance capacity. We focus on underwritingoriented companies because that's what we know. We invest in what we know. We have an investment committee, which oversees this activity with Victor, Laurent and a few other senior executives of the division. And we have a number of people who are coming from both finance and underwriting backgrounds, who are responsible for helping to develop these ideas and initiatives before we actually invest. So it's always a central partnership plus a local partnership in order to make this happen. We focus on relatively material investments. So we want to be a material part of the companies, which we're backing. We focus on long-term investments, which align incentives with the founders. And we focus on companies that are doing something that's particularly interesting in some sort of niche environment or niche capacity to avoid the competition issues that were mentioned earlier. So we're very excited about what we've done. Not all of our investments are public. But we've done a lot. And we believe we've got a very robust pipeline to continue to learn and potentially get attractive results from both the reinsurance and the investments that we're making. So any questions? Okay.\""
